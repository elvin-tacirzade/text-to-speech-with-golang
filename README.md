# Overview
You can use this project to convert a written text to audio. For this, after downloading the project, you need to say `go run main.go` and then enter the text. Since the project is made using the go programming language, the necessary documents for go must be on your computer.

You should set the `Google_API_Key` in the project for yourself.

You can see `Google_API_Key` and more information [here](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech).
